# Library System

This is a program that allows you to manage a library system. It allows you to create library accounts, view those records, and manage books (returns, availability, and borrowing). 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. To run the software, it is necessary to have Python installed as it is a python program. 
2. Clone the repository and open the librarySystem.py file.  

Instructions for using the software:

1. Make sure to pay attention to the accountID given when you create an account. It is necessary to know this infromation to be able to use the other functions in the program. 
2. This program is case sensitive so you must write book titles exactly as you see it presented. If not, then the program will not recognize that you are trying to refer to the book in the database. 
3. Read the instructions given for each step, they tell you what information you must provide in order to use the program. 

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* To recreate the development environment that I used for this program, you must download VS Code, which is the software I used to make this program. 
* There is no other software you need and there are no libraries needed as it is all imported in the librarySystem.py file.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to add a function that allows a user to find a book within a library system. 
* [ ] I want to improve the output that the program gives by formatting it so that it looks more presentable.
* [ ] I want to add a function that allows a user to add more books to the system.
* [ ] I want to add more functionality to the books table to include quantity of books and only allow users to get books if it is available and there are copies left in the library.
